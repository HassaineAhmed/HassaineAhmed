### Hello everyone

My name is Ahmed (aka EINSTEIN), 20 y.o, currently an engineering student at NATIONAL POLYTECHNIC SCHOOl of Algiers.
I start coding as a hobby when I was 12 y.o, started with java and then I slowly shifted to web development.
To day I am a web dev freelancer who uses and loves nextjs, I am also currently learning Data Science & AI to mix it with my development skills and build cool applications.
