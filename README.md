### Hello everyone

My name is Ahmed (aka EINSTEIN), 20 y.o, currently an engineering student at NATIONAL POLYTECHNIC SCHOOl of Algiers.

I start coding as a hobby when I was 12 y.o, started with java and then slowly shifted to web development.

Today I am a web dev freelancer who uses and loves nextjs, I am also currently learning Data Science & AI to mix it with my development skills to build cool applications.

Finally and most importantly I use VIM!! xD
